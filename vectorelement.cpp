    assign() – It assigns new value to the vector elements by replacing old ones
    push_back() – It push the elements into a vector from the back
    pop_back() – It is used to pop or remove elements from a vector from the back.
    insert() – It inserts new elements before the element at the specified position
    erase() – It is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
    swap() – It is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type. Sizes may differ.
    clear() – It is used to remove all the elements of the vector container
    emplace() – It extends the container by inserting new element at position
    emplace_back() – It is used to insert a new element into the vector container, the new element is added to the end of the vector
